        <p>&emsp;"In 2018, about 86% of the worldâ€™s children received vaccines that would protect them against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles. Immunizations currently prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths every year. Despite this success, more than 1.5 million people worldwide die from vaccine-preventable diseases each year." <i>~Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</i></p>
